# cloud-native
Cloud Native refers to a modern approach to building and running applications that leverage the benefits of cloud computing. It involves designing and deploying applications as a collection of loosely coupled microservices that can be easily scaled up or down based on demand, and can run in any cloud environment or on-premise infrastructure.

Cloud Native applications are typically developed using containerization technologies such as Docker, and managed using container orchestration platforms such as Kubernetes. They are also designed to take advantage of cloud-native services such as serverless computing, storage, and databases.

The Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) defines Cloud Native as a set of principles and practices that include containerization, dynamic orchestration, and declarative APIs. The goal of Cloud Native is to provide a scalable and resilient infrastructure that can adapt to changing business needs, improve developer productivity, and increase overall application agility and availability.
